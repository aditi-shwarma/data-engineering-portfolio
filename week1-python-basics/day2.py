# Variables and Data Types in Python
'''''
In Python, a variable is a name that stores data (a value) in the computer’s memory. It allows you to store, reuse, and modify data while a program is running.
Unlike some other languages, Python does not require you to declare the type of a variable explicitly. The type is decided automatically based on the value assigned.

# Assigning values to variables
age = 22              # integer variable
name = "Aditi"        # string variable
height = 5.4          # float variable
is_student = True     # boolean variable

# Printing variables
print(age)
print(name)
print(height)
print(is_student)


# Data types in Python
''''
In Python, data types define the kind of value a variable can store. They tell Python how the data should be stored and what operations can be performed on it.
